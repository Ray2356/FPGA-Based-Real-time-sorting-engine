2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111104] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111104]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111105] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111105]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111106] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111106]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111107] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111107]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111108] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111108]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111109] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111109]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111110] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111110]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rx/data[-1111111111] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rx/data[-1111111111]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk_in] (Source: C:/Users/yyuanaw/Downloads/UART_temp.xpr/UART_temp/UART_temp.srcs/constrs_1/new/uart_top_xdc.xdc (Line: 40))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk_in] (Source: c:/Users/yyuanaw/UART_2020_temp/UART_2020_temp.gen/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0/clk_wiz_0.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk_in] (Source: C:/Users/yyuanaw/Downloads/UART_temp.xpr/UART_temp/UART_temp.srcs/constrs_1/new/uart_top_xdc.xdc (Line: 40))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk_in] (Source: c:/Users/yyuanaw/UART_2020_temp/UART_2020_temp.gen/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0/clk_wiz_0.xdc (Line: 56))
