XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk_in] (Source: D:/Project_final/Project_final.srcs/constrs_1/new/uart_top_xdc.xdc (Line: 51))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk_in] (Source: d:/Project_final/Project_final.gen/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0/clk_wiz_0.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
